<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After installing the plugin and restarting Xournal++, the following keybinds are active:

| Keybind                | Action                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+Z`           | Undo last action/stroke    |
| `P`                    | Pen tool                   |
| `B`                    | Pen tool (alternate key)   |
| `E`                    | Eraser tool                |
| `T`                    | Text tool                  |
| `R`                    | Rectangular Select tool    |
| `S`                    | "Squiggly" Select tool     |
| `V`                    | Highlighter tool           |
| `X`                    | LaTeX tool                 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N`         | Create a new layer         |

ðŸ’¡ Tip: All keybinds can be used immediately after restarting Xournal++ with the plugin loaded. This makes switching tools much faster, especially when using a drawing tablet.


### Custom Keybinds

If you want to add your own keybinds or change existing ones, just edit the `main.lua` file in the plugin folder and modify the `"accelerator"` field for the action you want.  

**Example:**  
```lua
app.registerUi({
    ["menu"] = "My Custom Tool", --menu name in the xournal++ UI
    ["callback"] = "my_tool", --no need to change the callback its neccessary to keep the function working ;)
    ["accelerator"] = "<Control><Alt>M>"  -- Change this to any key combination you prefer
})
```
